    <h2>Some how I got this grand idea of learning to code, well here's my attempt...</h2>
   <div class="column"><p>Why I decided to <strong>pursue coding!</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>I wanted to challenge myself at something I had never done before</li>
      <li>Tech has become a huge part of Seattle's identity and I wanted to see
      first hand the basic underlining of what it meant to be a programmer</li>
      <li>Travel- I have a passion for traveling and the idea of working remotely
      from anywhere in the world was a key part in my decision to pursue coding
      although who wants to be staring at a computer screen, when Mt. Fuji staring
      at you</li>
